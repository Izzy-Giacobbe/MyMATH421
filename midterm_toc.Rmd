## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` or Quarto (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. 


**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use the Rmd templates of the class slides. 

- You can also use Quarto to create the presentation: *In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> Quarto Presentation...*
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can use `![](image.png){width="60%"}` or follow these below instructions.

    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient. 

Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=15QNBf6YYKocK2nNIfpKDer58kQnCPNZJ 

**Notice**

- Since this is a large dataset, you could try to run the codes on the smaller dataset, which is a portion of the original dataset before running the codes on the original data.  To create a random subset of the data you could use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# find the number of rows of the data
#n = nrow(df)

# subset 1000 rows of the data
#df1 = df[sample(1:n, 1000), ]
```


-------

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 

```{r}
library(haven)
df <- read_sas("C:/Users/student/Documents/GitHub/MyMATH421/midtermData.sas7bdat")

library(readr)
write_csv(df, "midterm.csv")

```

3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=18`)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
df1 <- df %>% 
  filter(yod==18)
```
    
4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r}
df2 <- df1 %>% select("yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day")
```


*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  Also notice that, empty values in the data before writing to csv may turn to NAs later when you re-read the file.

```{r}
write_csv(df2, 'midterm.csv')
```

5. What are variables that have missing values?

```{r}
colSums(is.na(df2))
```
```{r}
table(df2$admtype)
```
```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!(is.na(admtype) | admtype == ""))
df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!(is.na(admtype) | admtype == 9))
table(df2$admtype)
```
```{r}
table(df2$sex)
```
```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!(is.na(sex) | sex == 9))
table(df2$sex)
```
```{r}
table(df2$raceethn)
```
```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!(is.na(raceethn) | raceethn == ""))
table(df2$raceethn)
```
```{r}
table(df2$asource)
```
```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!(is.na(asource) | asource == ""))
table(df2$asource)
```
payfix, preopday, obs_hour, and nicu_day all have missing values

6. Remove all variables with missing values. 

```{r}

  filter(sex == 1) %>% 
  summarise(meanAge = mean(age, na.rm=TRUE))
```
```{r}
df2 %>% 
  filter(sex == 2) %>% 
  summarise(meanAge = mean(age, na.rm=TRUE)) 
```
On average, males are older than females.

12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  group_by(moa) %>% 
  summarise(meanAge = mean(age, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-meanAge)

```
Month one, January, has the oldest patients on average age. 

13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  select(provider, tot) %>% 
  arrange(-tot)
```

14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  filter(sex == 1, age >= 13 & age <= 19) %>% 
  group_by(provider) %>% 
  summarise(sumTot = sum(tot, na.rm=TRUE))%>% 
  arrange(sumTot)
```
Provider 7214 has the least total charge for teenage males on average, with $28,950.

15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season.  Which season has the longest length of stays on average?

```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>%
  mutate(Season = case_when(
    moa %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Spring",
    moa %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Summer",
    moa %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "Fall",
    TRUE ~ "Winter"
  ))
```

```{r}
df2<-df2 %>%
  mutate(lengthOfStayMonths = (yod - yoa) * 12 + (mod - moa))
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarise(meanLength = mean(lengthOfStayMonths, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-meanLength)
```
Fall on average has the longest length of stays.

16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  filter(age == 20, sex == 1, Season == "Fall") %>% 
  summarise(meanTot = mean(tot, na.rm = TRUE))
```
A 20 year old male staying in the Fall would on average be charged $30,956

17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points. 

In this section, I performed various data manipulation and analysis tasks on a dataset of healthcare-related information. I started by reading the data from a SAS file and filtered it to include only patients from the year 2018. I then selected a subset of variables for further analysis and removed variables with missing values. This section provided insights into patient demographics, admissions, and charges in the healthcare dataset. It highlighted variations in patient characteristics across different months, seasons, and providers. The results could be valuable for healthcare administrators looking to understand and improve healthcare services.

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis

2. Make an animation plot.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
custom_admtype_labels <- c(

  "2" = "Urgent",
  "3" = "Electric",
  "4" = "Newborn",
  "5" = "Trauma")
df2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tot, y = age, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(admtype) +
  labs(
    title = 'Admission Type: {closest_state}',
    x = "Total Charges",
    y = "Age",
    color = "Gender"
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Admission Type", labels = custom_admtype_labels) +  
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Gender", labels = c("1" = "Male", "2" = "Female")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Total Charges") +  
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Age") +  
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Gender"))  
```

3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

I created multiple plots and an animated plot to visualize the different relationships between total charges, age, gender admission types, admission sources, payment types, and race. The most common race was the white race and it had the highest count and highest amount for total charges for men and women.It was followed by the hispanic race and the black race. I found that the most common admission type among all the races and genders was emergency admissions, which make sense because if there is an emergency you go to RIH. There was a steady total patient charge throughout the year and it did not seem to spike anywhere in particular. The two most popular payment types were Medicare and RIte Care. Many people who were a white race had Medicare, while the rest had majority RIte Care. Many women also had RIte Care. This was between the ages 25-35 and spiked at 30. Many newborns had RIte Care as well. This is because many pregnant women use RIte Care. Many people under 65 had RIte Care, and the majortiy of people over 65 had Medicare, which makes sense because Medicare is for people 65 and up.

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 

*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
  
```{r}
medianTot <- median(df2$tot)
df2$target <- ifelse(df2$tot < medianTot, "low", "high")
inputVars <- df2 %>%
  select(age, sex, raceethn, provider, moa, mod, admtype, campus, los, target)
```
  
  
-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 

```{r}
library(caret)

df2 <- df2 %>%
  filter(raceethn != '', admtype != '') %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex),
         raceethn = as.factor(raceethn),
         provider = as.factor(provider),
         moa = as.factor(moa),
         mod = as.factor(mod),
         admtype = as.factor(admtype),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         target = as.factor(target)) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(age, los, tot), as.numeric))

set.seed(2020)

# random sample the rows
inputVars <- inputVars %>%
  sample_frac(0.1)

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df2$target, p = .90, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- inputVars[splitIndex,]
df_test <- inputVars[-splitIndex,]

#df_train$target <- as.factor(ifelse(df_train$target == "low", 0, 1))

df_train <- df_train[complete.cases(df_train),]
colnames(df_train)[colSums(is.na(df_train)) > 0]

df_test$target <- as.factor(df_test$target)


```
2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 

```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

tree_control <- rpart.control(maxdepth = 3)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = inputVars, method = "class", control = tree_control)

library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
```
```{r}
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
```

3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 

```{r}
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tree <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "rpart2", 
                                trControl = trControl)
forest_ranger <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                    method = "ranger", 
                                trControl = trControl)
results <- resamples(list('Decision Tree' = tree,
                          'Random Forest' = forest_ranger))
plot(tree)
plot(forest_ranger)
```

4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 

```{r}
bwplot(results)
```

5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data. 
My final selection would be the random forest because it has a higher accuracy.
```{r}
pred <- predict(forest_ranger, df_test)
pred <- factor(pred, levels = levels(df_test$target))
levels(df_test$target)
levels(pred)


cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = "high")
cm$overall[1]

6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 

```{r}
meanTot <- mean(df2$tot)
df2$target <- ifelse(df2$tot < meanTot, "low", "high")
inputVars <- df2 %>%
  select(age, sex, raceethn, provider, moa, mod, admtype, campus, los, target)
```

```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>%
  filter(raceethn != '', admtype != '') %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex),
         raceethn = as.factor(raceethn),
         provider = as.factor(provider),
         moa = as.factor(moa),
         mod = as.factor(mod),
         admtype = as.factor(admtype),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         target = as.factor(target)) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(age, los, tot), as.numeric))

set.seed(2020)

# random sample the rows
inputVars <- inputVars %>%
  sample_frac(0.1)

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df2$target, p = .90, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- inputVars[splitIndex,]
df_test <- inputVars[-splitIndex,]

#df_train$target <- as.factor(ifelse(df_train$target == "low", 0, 1))

df_train <- df_train[complete.cases(df_train),]
colnames(df_train)[colSums(is.na(df_train)) > 0]

df_test$target <- as.factor(df_test$target)
```
```{r}
tree_control <- rpart.control(maxdepth = 3)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = inputVars, method = "class", control = tree_control)

fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
```
```{r}
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
```

```{r}
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tree <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "rpart2", 
                                trControl = trControl)
forest_ranger <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                    method = "ranger", 
                                trControl = trControl)
results <- resamples(list('Decision Tree' = tree,
                          'Random Forest' = forest_ranger))
plot(tree)
plot(forest_ranger)
```
```{r}
bwplot(results)
```
My final selection would be the random forest because it has a higher accuracy.

```{r}
pred <- predict(forest_ranger, df_test)
pred <- factor(pred, levels = levels(df_test$target))
levels(df_test$target)
levels(pred)


cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = "high")
cm$overall[1]
```

7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

In this section, I created two different targets and used the same models on them to compare which target had a greater accuracy in the end. When the target variable was the median and the mean, both times the random forest model had a higher accuracy and was used on the testing data set. This is probably because the random forest model (over a decision tree model) reduces overfitting and improves generalization. The mean has a higher accuracy than the median, and this could be because the data set is normally distributed and no outliers skewed it in any direction.
