# Questions 4, 5, & 6 in Part III

---
# Question 4

![Alt Text](V11.png)
---
# Question 5

--
- My final selection would be the random forest because it has a higher accuracy.

--

- When testing the accuracy of the model on the testing data, I got an accuracy of 0.8200772 

--

- This makes sense because random forests tend to have higher accuracy than just an individual decision tree.

--

- Random forests also help with over fitting and are more stable compared to decision trees.

#Conclusion

--
- My final selection would, once again, be the random forest because it has a higher accuracy.

--

- When testing the accuracy of the model on the testing data, I got an accuracy of 0.8449799. 

--

- This accuracy for the mean is higher than the one for the median.

--

- This could be because of the distribution of the data and outliers.
